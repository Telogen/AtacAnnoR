Description: AtacAnnoR is a novel method designed for scATAC-seq cell type annotation using well-labeled scRNA-seq data as reference. 
AtacAnnoR can accurately annotate the cell types of scATAC-seq under every situation. 
The key to the robustness of it is the use of the two-rounds annotation successfully avoids the batch effects.
